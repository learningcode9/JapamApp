/**
 * Repository layer for Japam Workspaces — the ONLY place in the app that knows HOW Japams are
 * persisted. Today that's AsyncStorage only. When Supabase sync is added, it is added ENTIRELY
 * INSIDE this file (e.g. a best-effort background upsert after each local write, mirroring
 * historyStore.ts's local-first-then-sync discipline, or a merge on load) — CurrentJapamContext
 * and every UI screen call these exact same function names with the exact same signatures either
 * way and never need to change. That is the whole point of this layer existing.
 *
 * Every mutation here is self-contained: it reads the current persisted state itself (rather than
 * requiring the caller to pass in whatever it happens to have in memory), applies the relevant
 * pure transformation from lib/japams.ts, persists, and returns the result. This avoids a lost-
 * update race between the caller's in-memory cache and what's actually persisted — a concern that
 * becomes real, not hypothetical, once a background sync can also write to storage independently.
 *
 * CurrentJapamContext owns RUNTIME state (the in-memory japams list, which one is selected). This
 * file owns PERSISTENCE. Selection logic (e.g. "which Japam should become current after this
 * archive") deliberately stays in the Context, not here — that's a runtime concern, not a storage
 * concern.
